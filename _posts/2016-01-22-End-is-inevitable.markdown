It was a serene beautiful morning. The house was situated in a lush green scenic beauty residing within the suburbs of Himalayas reflecting its grand demeanor, surrounded by the forest of Deodar. The pristine water flowing through  stream nearby was a reflection of the piety of nature and the chirping of birds instills ones soul with melody of Gods.The cool breeze in the air was hurling with a touch of divinity.The child came out of the house with a cricket ball in his hand running towards the lush green garden in front of the house and started playing. Mother was preparing breakfast for her little prince. It was 7 am in the morning. Suddenly the boy saw that the wind speed was proliferating and the next moment without any prudence, a huge avalanche was followed behind the house and engulfed everything it could including child, mother and everything. Just one moment and everything was vanished!!

Is this a cruelty of nature showing its wrath upon the humans? Or are we becoming too mawkish to judge the situation? Or is there other side of the story also? Do you know why Dinosaurs were extirpated from earth? Perhaps the story always falls into dark embellished by the abhorrent nature of humans who is so dominated and self-obsessed in the food chain cycle.Let me recapitulate some of the big headlines from the last year news. Polar Vortex hits North America, Mount Everest avalanche, Uttarakhand Flood tragedy swiping thousands of humans on its wrath,Wildfires in California destroying more than 150 homes in Northern California,Cyclone Hudhud hits Odisha, and the recent biggest loss to humans in Nepal earthquake in April 25,2015. Seeing these stats one could  possibly impose imprecations on the God and the creator of this earth.

It is the over possessive greed of humans and its dominance in the food chain that have left the whole humanity in the path of the great destruction of its own species. Greed has poisoned mans soul and filled the world with hate, which goosed us into misery and blood shed. Medical institutions which are meant to save life are busy filling their pockets while a dying man still lies in the bed. Corrupt government has left the poor in the dearths of dark and raises puissant towards the heaps of wealth. Before helping a thirsty we fill our throat first, our knowledge has made us cynical. The technology has developed speed, heights but left us shut inside, and in this madness we are killing the very inhabitant of ours. We don't think twice before building a corporate empire by superseding thousands of trees. The same river Ganga which we considered holy and pious, left polluted by our own inactions. Place which considered serene and peaceful are left imprinted by the stains of our own feet.We are exploding so much into numbers that if one saw the earth from space 2 millions years ago and now, one can clearly limn that we humans are like plague that spreads exponentially.With each new born, the mass of earth correspondingly increases, howsoever small we think but earth is suffocating from the population explosion.

In this so fast running life, where everyday a new revolution divest itself for human services, we don't even give a second thought that this nature has created us, and we are a part of it, not otherwise. From the same clay you and I were born, don't you think that we are an immutable part of this nature and the very purpose of our landing here is not ruling, suppressing, and destroying. Why we think too much and feel too little? And when Nature tries to balance out the equilibrium, we call it disaster, rather I call it  just a mechanism of nature to balance out the overburdening of human actions. We became paralyzed when such catastrophe happens and our whole emotions starts dancing forward in form of fear, pain and agony. We wept for our losses in the great destruction of earthquake in Nepal as we humans are full of attachments and I don't deny emotions as inapt, but don't you think that we are too judgmental to impute. Perhaps if I extrapolate my hypothesis of nature's process of maintaining equilibrium I would say that as dinosaurs races was once eliminated from the earth, in a very similar manner someday we will be supplanted by Nature and  new species will born and will be given a chance to start a whole new beginning just as we were given since primordial. Everything will start from zero. May be the species will be a new creation in physical form but the consciousness will remain same as we have today(well why consciousness will remain same, its a whole new dimension which we will talk about some other time :-) ).

I hope if we as a human understand that we all are tangled through the same thread provided by nature, and that we are an inevitable part of it which binds us together in the form of love and harmony, than I think the child playing in the bright sunny morning and mother making breakfast for her son won't be absorbed in dark by our own inhuman conscious. If as an individual we fulfill our purpose without endangering the creation of ours than this world will be full of joy, beauty and harmony. As one of my source of inspiration from my college, professor Kashyap sir once said "God sends souls to earth on sabbatical for peace and love. Human beings waste it with ego-fight, agony, despair, rivalry and hatred. What an utter misfortune.....  "
