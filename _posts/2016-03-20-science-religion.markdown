**Sun** slowly gazing towards the west bathing the earth with its golden light, reverberating a whole new sky afterward in the form of stars, planets and a colorful aura which heals the eyes and mind. To a man, this world is full of mysteries and quests.But these spellbinding phenomenons of universe instigate questions in mind like Who created us? Does god exist? How is this World originated? Why is this earth so special to support life? What is out position relative to the universe? These inexplicable conundrums transcend our mind to unveil the unaccountable and unseen paradigms behind them, and in the conquest of finding the solutions to these mysteries, our ancesters discovered two methods for preaching truths in life. One is objective way of Science and other being subjective way of Spirituality or Religion. Now to a skeptical person this may seem to be dissensive. He would believe in a singularity of the methods for preaching. He would say that only science can discern the truth while the other say only the spirituality can show you the truth. But what I believe that both deserve to be treated equally. There is no point in saying my cooking recipe is good than yours. It simply the recipe you enjoy the most finds you more attractive. Both the mighty streams of science and religion are the magnificent products of human thinking pattern. Both preaches towards the truth.

While science is based on reasoning through external stimuli of our senses and perception and based on complete mathematical formulation, the religion relies on a complete realization of something. So In words of swami vivekananda how he describes this is as: Science is believing in “How” or about the inception of anything while Religion is based on “Why” about anything. To elucidate this point let me tell you an example as told by swamiji itself in order to understand the convergence of these two might streams of the human mind.

Imagine the beautiful Himalayas. Now imagine that you are standing with your friend at the dawn on a vast meadow surrounded by the snow peaks. The sun is just emerging and bathing the earth with its light. The lights peak up and shimmers. But the sky is overcast, a thundercloud emerges and soon there is a drizzle. Soon the sky clears up and a rainbow appears. The sheer beauty of the scenery would send the poets and artists into raptures. However your friend is a scientist and purely believes in the mathematical concepts of the world. So he asks,”How did this happen?” he analysis the raindrops- white light incident at an angle on rain drops which serves as a prism, gets split into various frequencies or electromagnetic radiation.The emerging light gets splitted into 7 constituents of light which we call VIBGYOR, also known as a rainbow. So the principle thoughts operating in his mind are nothing but Quantification (measuring the physical quantity, here white light), a perfect mechanism to explain the phenomenon and finally an appropriate deduction from it which in this case is the Rainbow.You also watched the same phenomenon and let us presume that you are more spiritual in your approach or “Why” oriented. You focus on the cause of the phenomenon you are witnessing, which in this example is the raindrop acting as a prism. The changes in the refractive index of the surrounding with respect to the water drops is an actual cause behind the refraction.You try to unearth the “Why” of the matter and leave behind the “How” to your scientific friend. So you finally conclude that rainbow is an illusion caused into the atmosphere due to the presence of the moisture in the air.

So you took the holistic view of the phenomenon while your scientific friend took the atomic view of the same. This is exactly what is truth. Both the method of science and religion are tempered for the truth and both consume the same amount of human intelligence, only the orientation of mind is different.Religion is nothing but the realization of something. A man is hungry. As an instrument to judge his hunger you would implement various biological experiments of objective science on the man to deduce the state of his hunger while as a subjective truth you would know that hunger is not an alien experience to you, so you reason on your own experience and faith.Its all about the recipe you like to enjoy whether you want to test it by science or reason it by your religion. So I think that it is inappropriate to judge another's perception about the way of their thinking. It is truly condemnable to point the people who wear saffron turbans. But one must not accept the concept blindly. To me, Religion/spirituality is as equally logical and rational as science is. One must reason the validity of any principle that any religions throws at you, and only when you find the strings which answer all your question than it should be accepted and followed.
So enjoy little things, try to reason with science or religion, what matters is ultimately the revelation of truth to yourself.
