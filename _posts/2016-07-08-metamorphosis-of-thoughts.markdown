**Metamorphosis**: The process of transformation from an immature form to an adult form in two or more distinct stages. This is how google rightly explains it. Very similar to this our life also changes from our childhood to rest of our life. Our thought processing changes every time from one moment to another, thus forming our persona. So we all in some sort have gone through this same process. We are different today than what we were yesterday and this is how daily a metamorphosis happens in our life.But Does this change imply any good? what kind of change is this?

Last summers when I was at home, I went on an evening track from a place name Kesardevi to my home. It was a 7km track. While coming back down from Kesardevi you can see the sun setting down behind the mountains while showering golden rays in the sky. I was coming down and realise something was following me. I looked back and I saw at the end of the road a small girl was standing with a highly strung face. First I thought she must be going back home with her parents and may have walked a little fast that she overcome her parents on her way down. But then she seemed very alarmed and panicked as if she has lost her way back home in the middle of this solitary place. I thought  where could she be from? and what is she doing alone here? I moved back and went closer to her to ask about her whereabouts, but she was so scared that the tears started rolling down her cheeks. I felt very awkward and helpless. I didn't know what to ask this little girl. But anyhow I gathered all my courage and asked her what is her name? she didn't reply. I asked where are her mum and pa. she didn't reply and continued crying with all the tears left in her eyes. The air was silent. Leaves of the trees were gazing the child's face, and the sun seems to be stopped at its position.Everything seems so shunned at that moment infront of the child.

After a while being there with her. I again asked to her name. She was silent but now at least tears were gone. She then herself pleaded to me "Did you see my papa?". I wished and plead from inside that I wish I knew her dad. I told her that we will find her dad together and so asked her to follow me and then I lead her to a nearby human habitat. Meanwhile, on the way, I asked her why she is searching her dad? Is he missing? She sobbed and then said in a very honest and innocent way - "My dad drinks lots, and yesterday night after he finished his drink, he beat me because I asked her to play  with me. He left home saying he will be back soon, but he is not home yet" then she said "Do you know where is the nearby temple her, I wanna meet with god and ask her to help find me, GOD"

Now at that moment everything froze before my eyes. I was very shocked at the reply of the little girl. I was surely not expecting that from her.  If you try to picture this, you will realise so many things about that little girl. she was so innocent, pure-hearted, and after all the pathetic acts of her dad, she still loves her drunken silly dad. Now, what you call for this two different standpoint,one with the emotion of a little girl with the emotions of her drunken dad?
I felt so pity on how her dad had made a living hell in his own house, and even in that hell, a small girl finds a heaven. To his daughter he is still a hero. A man who was once fully functional and filled with all childlike vigor has now become a symbol of darkness, hate and disappointment.

This small incident made me realise that some people poisoned their thoughts and in that process we are not only affecting us, we are affecting the whole balance of life. It's a ripple effect. The girl who has come to this earth as a very pure and noble in thoughts might become cynical in future. The one who is robbed today will rob other tomorrows. Why we are so easily hunted down by our negative thoughts than by positive. why our motivation dies after some time. Why this metamorphosis changes our darker side more. Our thoughts changes but It should be filled with love,compassion and peace, not with hatred and sadness.

Perhaps we are not as powerful and as pure as that little girl. Once our thoughts are distilled I think then will be the actual metamorphosis of our thoughts will happen.
