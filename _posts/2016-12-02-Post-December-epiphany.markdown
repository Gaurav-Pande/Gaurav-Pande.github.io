**A**re you really loving what you do? Or Are you really doing what you love? 
Both sounds similar but to my point of view both are different. If we live our lives on the hands of circumstances/God wherever 
they drag us, we have two options either to "quit and start doing which you love" or "start loving what the circumstances have offered".
It's never like one is right and other is wrong. One can excel in both of the scenarios if you have a very strong desire
to get something. As I can rightly correlate this to one of the lessons in "search of God" thing. 

In Vedanta philosophy, it is written that there are simply 2 steps to getting closer to GOD or spiritual reality. 

  * Vyakulta or the desire to know god.
  * Faith towards what you believe.

So if we for a moment remove the duality of our lives and adopt these 2 principles considering our desire/passion/dream as our God,
and have a burning desire to reach that goal, then whatever the life will throw at you, you won't care about it except for your passion.
And if you in that process somehow attained this stage of Vyakulta or desires to know something, you will need the 
second part called faith.

Now faith is a very tricky concept( well yeah it's still a concept to me as I am still not a very faith loving person ). Let me tell you
something very correlating to faith in mathematics. In Proof by Induction, we always have an assumption ready, where we say
"Let us assume x is true, or Let x is the final outcome which we want to prove". So you see in maths while proving something we need to
have a little faith/assumption that yes intially X or Y value  is true and now let's see how this can lead us to the final desired result.
That is faith. Isn't it!! If you hadn't assumed some variable to be true, than you might not have proved the statement as true.


But proves of mathematics are ephemeral. You need to assume not for so long, just until "Hence proved" statement. But in real life, you are supposed to have that faith
towards your destiny throughout your life, and that is true and hardest to digest as well.


Here is a video that I saw some days back.  It's a nice speech.
