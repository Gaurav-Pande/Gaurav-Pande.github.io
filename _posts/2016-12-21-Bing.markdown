Well I started learning Python lately and found it pretty awesome and easy to use, specifically in the way we can automate our
tasks. You can do many cool stuffs with python from machine learning to build your own py bots. So here I just tried to build 
a script which will download the daily Bing wallpaper to your Directory and will make it your desktop background.

I built this app using python3 for my Mac pro, you can edit it any way to run it on any other OS/Machine. 

Here goes the script for it:

Next target to do is : Facebook bot :-)

```language-python
#!/usr/bin/python3
import os
import json
import datetime
from urllib import error, request
import codecs
import  time
import subprocess

SCRIPT = """/usr/bin/osascript<<END
tell application "Finder"
set desktop picture to POSIX file "%s"
end tell
END"""

zone = "en-US"
resolution = '1920x1080'
Dir =  "/Users/Your-user/Documents/BingWallPapers/"
Wallpaper_Name = "Today_wallpaper.jpg"


def main():
    i = 1
    while (i == 1):
        try:
            request.urlopen("https://www.google.co.in")
            print ("Checking network connectivity!!!")
        except error.URLError as e:
            time.sleep(5)
        else:
            print ("Connection Successfull!!")
            i = 0
            reader = codecs.getreader("utf-8")
            response = request.urlopen("http://www.bing.com/HPImageArchive.aspx?format=js&idx=0&n=1&mkt=" + zone)
            json_obj = json.load(reader(response))
            url = (json_obj['images'][0]['urlbase'])
            url = url = 'http://www.bing.com' + url + '_' + resolution + '.jpg'

            #create the Bing directory
            if not os.path.exists(Dir):
                os.makedirs(Dir)
            path = Dir + Wallpaper_Name


            if os.path.exists(path):
                today_date = datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%m/%d/%Y")
                file_date = time.strftime('%m/%d/%Y',time.gmtime(os.path.getatime(path)))
                if today_date == file_date:
                    print ("Already have the wallpaper for today")
                    setwallpaper(path)
                else:
                    print ("Downloading Bing wallpaper to %s" % path)
                    f = open(path,'wb')
                    bing_picture =  request.urlopen(url)
                    f.write(bing_picture.read())
                    setwallpaper(path)
            else:
                print ("Downloading Bing wallpaper to %s" % path)
                f = open(path,'wb')
                bing_picture = request.urlopen(url)
                f.write(bing_picture.read())
                setwallpaper(path)


def setwallpaper(path):
    print("setting as the desktop background")
    subprocess.Popen(SCRIPT % path, shell=True)



if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
