## Disclaimer 

[NOTE]: I AM CURRENTLY AN ON CAMPUS STUDENT, SO THIS INFORMATION MAY BE OUTDATED. PLEASE EMAIL YOUR ADVISOR FOR DETAIL INFORMATION IF THE BELOW DOES NOT HELP.


All the information mentioned in this blog are my own personal experience. I matriculated for fall 2018 semesters, so these opinions are based on that time.You are free to accept, reject and correct these opinions. I believe that standard process post admit does not change much over the time. Here are the points which I felt are the most important points one should know once you got an admit. You can absolutly find all these info in the faq and other documents over the web(I have shared such some important links at the end as well)

## Getting Started with Gatech :)

So, finally here you are landing on this page after getting an admit from gatech omscs program. I  am pretty sure you must be very much excited as much as I am. In this post I am going to jot down some points which helps me through the onboarding process after I get an admit for the program.

### Assumptions:

I am assuming that you have already received a department admit and a college admit from gatech, and now you are thinking: OK, what to do next? 

### First thing first:

After you get your admit, first thing you need to check is you passport account:[link](https://passport.gatech.edu). Passport is your account management portal, from where you can:
* Change your passwords. 
* Set email preferences.
* Set 2 factor authentication.

The most important thing is you should be able to access this portal, if not please activate your account here([link](https://passport.gatech.edu/activation/select-affiliation))  by looking up your GtID.

The above mentioned links are the most important points you will need to do as you start your journey, you wanna make sure you have an student email account and also you should have setup your authentication services properly. 


### The Big Billion Question ?

"_I have received an admit and now i have to submit the official transcript, is it ok to submit he xerox or do we need to send original, if yes than which courier to use..blah blah!!_"

Well this is the most frequent question that I have seen in whatsapp groups and in google plus community.

#### Answer:

Yes you have to submit your official degree certificate(the one you get from your university) and your transcript(a compiled version of your all semesters marksheets).

How ?

First this is what admission support team replied to me:

_"Official transcripts can be delivered in several ways. Most common are those delivered directly to Georgia Tech from your academic institution. Some institutions also provide certified PDFs to alumni for use in graduate applications, as well as sealed, physical transcripts. If you are accepted to OMS CS, you will be asked to verify your unofficial transcript provided at the time of application with an official copy through one of these methods. However, if you decide to send your own official transcripts please provide your full name and GTID# when submitting your transcripts. You can send your official transcript by the method listed below._

_Graduate Admissions
Georgia Institute of Technology
631 Cherry Street, room 318
Atlanta, GA 30332-0321_

_We suggest that you send all your official transcripts immediately for processing. Please keep in mind graduate studies is responsible for processing documents for all the Georgia Tech programs campus wide which can slow down your documents being processed for fall 2018 term if you wait to send your documents close to the beginning off fall 2018 term. The earlier you send in your official transcripts the better. Outstanding official transcripts/documents may cause you to have a hold on your account preventing you from registering for fall 2018 classes."_


Well, there are 2 options:

1. You can send your orginal degree certificate and transcript to the university for verification, but university doesnt take responsibility to return your degree and transcript :D yes, you have to tie up with some courier services like DHL for picking up your documents from the university and bring them back to your home safely.

2. More preferable option is to send the attested copies of your documents to the university. You can only attest your documents from the university from where you matriculated. What I did is I attested my degree certificate and transcripts in a sealed enevelope from my university. This is a standard process and I am sure your university too have similar methods. 



OK, cool but what is the deadline to submit these docs?

For those admitted to fall 2018, the deadline to submit the transcript was untill the end of Fall 2018 that is untill December 2018.

Ok, what if I miss that as well?

Than for next term, which will be spring 2019 you will not be able to register for courses and you will see a hold when you will try to book a course.

So Suggestion is submit the documents as soon as possible once you receive the admit!



## Cool, What Next than?

Well than buckle up and get ready to start your enthralling journey :P

In my opinion until your sem start do visit these links in the order I have mentioned(these will answer most of your all queries):

3. Check out the current courses: [link](https://www.omscs.gatech.edu/current-courses)

	* Try to figure out which 2 courses you want to take in your first sem, and remember you have to finish 2 foundational courses from this link within an year from your recieve an admit.

Well, Have patience :) you will get email from your advisors very soon with detailed pdfs and instruction to follow on those. 

Before that still you feel like you have some spare time,  watch the orientation video course which describes each and every steps from registering a courses to drop a course  here: [link](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAwxTw4SYaPmVSQFhl4waWA7YWA-WKQuT)


I am not sharing links and details on these inforamtion as these things might change like for example, in our case in fall 2018 sem the courses that I have taken are not hosted on udacity, rather it was on canvas. So, better you wait for your advisors email.


Hope these informatoin helps. Let me know if something has changed or some correction is needed [gpande@gatech.edu] :)

Good luck!
