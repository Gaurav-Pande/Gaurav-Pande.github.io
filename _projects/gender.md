This project aims to learn the machine learning  basics and also use redhat opendhift to deploy the same application. 
The code uses the scikit-learn machine learning library to train a decision tree on a small dataset of body human names with (height, width, and shoe size) labeled male or female. Then we can predict the gender of someone given a name, and it will showcase a random picture of based on the name you type. I build this code on the top of the flask web based application, where one can simply type the name and click submit button.

Insatallation steps are written in the README file in the repo.
