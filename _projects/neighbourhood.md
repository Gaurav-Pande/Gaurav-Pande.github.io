**I** still vividly remember when I was exposed to the unseen world of technology for the first time in 7th standard, being nominated for the project - “Mapping The Neighbourhood” which was launched by the Department of Science & Technology, Government Of India. The project aimed at pinning up geographical locations with the aid of palmtop computers and GPS assisting to sketch complex altimeters which in turn would help the government to formulate developmental projects of rural areas.My naive mind was magnificently captivated by this technological errand of almost two years.This propelled me to unveil the working of an indispensable set of events that taciturnly run behind the scenes. I was perpetually fascinated by the miracles of science through mathematical concepts and proofs.

We visted many geographical location nearby and pinned their maps and than educate the people about the natural problems occuring in the rural areas like, water wastage in the village in rainy season due to lack of rainwater harvesting. Here using maps we educate the villagers on the areas in the village which are apt for storing water due to their geographical structure and shape.
