This programme is premised on the idea that the process of collecting information and displaying it in a user-friendly way can generate awareness and build a sense of responsibility toward the environment. Young people, organisers believe, can be agents of change when it comes to realising and communicating the 'intrinsic value' of maps and mapping. Through education they can, that is, act as channels for the dissemination of scientific and technical knowledge. The idea is that the energetic and enthusiastic participation on the part of the young community of Indian students across the nation can help generate data for better planning of developmental activities at the local level. This strategy is based on the premise that maps can be used as a tool for:

* Representing - in a visual medium - the interrelationship between actual places
* Providing information that supports understanding of one's surroundings
* Involving communities for more interaction with their immediate natural and built environment
* Facilitating efforts on the part of small communities to communicate the extent of their demand/need from government agencies.


**I** still vividly remember when I was exposed to the unseen world of technology for the first time in 7th standard, being nominated for the project - “Mapping The Neighbourhood” which was launched by the Department of Science & Technology, Government Of India. The project aimed at pinning up geographical locations with the aid of palmtop computers and GPS assisting to sketch complex altimeters which in turn would help the government to formulate developmental projects of rural areas.My naive mind was magnificently captivated by this technological errand of almost two years.This propelled me to unveil the working of an indispensable set of events that taciturnly run behind the scenes. I was perpetually fascinated by the miracles of science through mathematical concepts and proofs.

We visted many geographical location nearby and pinned their maps and than educate the people about the natural problems occuring in the rural areas like, water wastage in the village in rainy season due to lack of rainwater harvesting. Here using maps we educate the villagers on the areas in the village which are apt for storing water due to their geographical structure and shape.
