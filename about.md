### “Stay Hungry Stay Foolish”

As the quote exemplifies about feeding the hunger for acquiring knowledge so is my life propels by the same principle. I still vividly remember when I was exposed to the unseen world of technology for the first time in 7th standard, being nominated for the project - “Mapping The Neighbourhood” which was launched by the Department of Science & Technology, Government Of India. The project aimed at pinning up geographical locations with the aid of palmtop computers and GPS assisting to sketch complex altimeters which in turn would help the government to formulate developmental projects of rural areas.My naive mind was magnificently captivated by this technological errand of almost two years.This propelled me to unveil the working of an indispensable set of events that taciturnly run behind the scenes. I was perpetually fascinated by the miracles of science through mathematical concepts and proofs.Therefore, mathematics became one of my charm & strongholds.I performed consistently with outstanding grades and always stood as the topper of my class throughout schooling(class 6-12). I scored 91% in class 10th and 95% in class 12th mathematics. My interest in maths proliferated during college where Advanced Integral and Differential Calculus became one of my favourite topics and I scored 95% in Engineering mathematics.My inclination towards maths and logical reasoning formulated my coding skills with ease and encouraged my mind to join the Department of Computer Science in Gobind Ballabh Pant University Of Agriculture & Technology.In this university, I got acquainted with the myriad world of computer science. Computer Networking, Data Structures and Algorithms always drew my keen attention.

During sophomore, I attended a training on Networking from one of the prestigious institutes of India- Nettech, and it was then that I realised my ambition in Networking. I grasped knowledge on Networking, starting with how to make LAN cables, configuring LINUX, administering it, and troubleshooting, it was a “wrack-your-brains-till-it-drains” experience ranging from tit-bits of basics of Networking to ipv4 addressing, routing, routing algorithms, Linux networking, Telnet configuration, Ftp, Firewall & Iptables, DNS, DHCP and Samba configuration.
