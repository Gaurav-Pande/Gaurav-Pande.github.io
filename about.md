### Stay Hungry Stay Foolish


 
 I still vividly remember when I was exposed to the unseen world of technology for the first time in 7th standard, being 
 nominated for the project - “Mapping The Neighbourhood” which was launched by the Department of Science & Technology, 
 Government Of India. The project aimed at pinning up geographical locations with the aid of palmtop computers and GPS 
 assisting to sketch complex altimeters which in turn would help the government to formulate developmental projects of rural
 areas.My naive mind was magnificently captivated by this technological errand of almost two years.This propelled me to unveil 
 the working of an indispensable set of events that taciturnly run behind the scenes. I was perpetually fascinated by the 
 miracles of science through mathematical concepts and proofs.Therefore, mathematics became one of my charm & strongholds.My 
 interest in maths proliferated during college where Advanced Integral and Differential Calculus became one of my favourite 
 topics.My inclination towards maths and logical reasoning formulated my coding skills with ease and encouraged my mind to 
 join the Department of Computer Science in Gobind Ballabh Pant University Of Agriculture & Technology.In this university, I 
 got acquainted with the myriad world of computer science. Computer Networking, Data Structures and Algorithms always drew my 
 keen attention.

Currently I am a Software Engineer in Cisco Systems India, working towards reshaping the Networks using Programmability and
automation. My key areas of interests lies in Software Define Networking, Network Telemetry, Network Programmability and 
Machine Learning.
