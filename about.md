### Stay Hungry Stay Foolish

Hi, 

I am currently pursuing my masters in Computer Science(specialization-Machine Learning) from Georgia Institute of Technology. Previously I have worked for Cisco systems innovation edge team as a Software Engineer working on vast variety of use cases based on machine learning and automation. I am currently understanding Machine learning to better understand the underlying complexities and jargons. I want to understand things clearly and explain them well.

My current research interests in academia are in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and their implications on the real world production based environment. In the next few semesters at Georgia Tech, I will be delving myself into the mathematical background behind Machine learning and Deep Learning techniques. I am also acting as a Graduate Teaching Assitant and student researcher, working to solve Volumetric anomalies from the Network using tensor decomposition and Time series analysis.


I still vividly remember when I was exposed to the unseen world of technology for the first time in 7th standard, being selected for the project - “Mapping The Neighbourhood” which was launched by the Department of Science & Technology, Government Of India. The project aimed at pinning up geographical locations with the aid of palmtop computers and GPS assisting to sketch complex altimeters which in turn would help the government to formulate developmental projects of rural areas.My naive mind was magnificently captivated by this technological errand of almost two years.This propelled me to unveil the working of an indispensable set of events that taciturnly run behind the scenes. 

I was perpetually fascinated by the miracles of science through mathematical concepts and proofs. Therefore, mathematics became one of my charm & strongholds. My interest in maths proliferated during college where Advanced Integral and Differential Calculus became one of my favourite topics. My inclination towards maths and logical reasoning formulated my coding skills with ease and encouraged my mind to join the Department of Computer Science in Gobind Ballabh Pant University Of Agriculture & Technology.In this university, I got acquainted with the myriad world of computer science. Mathematics, Data Structures and Algorithms always drew my keen attention.

Things we do however small they are, things we follow around us, the life we live, somehow directly or indirectly affects the universe. Universe is a big pool of life and I am just a little tiny drop of it living here on earth at its fullest :).
