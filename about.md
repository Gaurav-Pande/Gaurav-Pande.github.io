Hi! I am Gaurav, I am a 2nd year Master's student in Computer Science (Specializing in Machine Learning) at <a href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/">Georgia Tech</a>. I am primarily doing my course work. In past semesters I have worked on research problems in the domain of Natural Language Processing under Prof <a href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~dyang888/index.html">Diyi yang</a>. For the summers of 2020, I'm working as a Machine Learning Intern in the Hands on Lab team at VMware.

Previously, I have worked for Cisco systems <a href="https://cisco-ie.github.io/index.html">Innovation edge</a>  team as a Technical Solutions Specialist working on vast variety of use cases based on machine learning and automation. While working in Cisco, I Provided expertise in software developing in Python and Java for both front-end and back-end solutions, leveraging numerous OpenSource tools and platforms, in addition to both proprietary and industry standard APIs. I have also spend an year contributing towards an opensource organization <a href="https://github.com/opendaylight/cardinal/graphs/contributors">OpendayLight</a>: a distributed  Software Define Networking controller.

<!-- <h3>Research Interests</h3>

My research interests lie in the broad area of Natural Language Proce. Specifically, I'm interested in building AI agents, that can communicate (Natural Langauge Processing) and act (Robotics) while being grounded in a given environment (Computer vision).
